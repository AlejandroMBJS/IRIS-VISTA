 Option 1: Remove all requests only (keep users)
  docker exec -it <container_name> sqlite3 /app/data/vista.db "
  DELETE FROM request_histories;
  DELETE FROM purchase_request_items;
  DELETE FROM purchase_requests;
  DELETE FROM cart_items;
  DELETE FROM notifications;
  DELETE FROM activity_logs;
  "

  Option 2: Reset everything but keep admin user
  docker exec -it <container_name> sqlite3 /app/data/vista.db "
  DELETE FROM request_histories;
  DELETE FROM purchase_request_items;
  DELETE FROM purchase_requests;
  DELETE FROM cart_items;
  DELETE FROM notifications;
  DELETE FROM activity_logs;
  DELETE FROM audit_logs;
  DELETE FROM users WHERE employee_number != 'admin';
  "

  Option 3: Complete reset (will recreate admin on restart)
  docker exec -it <container_name> sqlite3 /app/data/vista.db "
  DELETE FROM request_histories;
  DELETE FROM purchase_request_items;
  DELETE FROM purchase_requests;
  DELETE FROM cart_items;
  DELETE FROM notifications;
  DELETE FROM activity_logs;
  DELETE FROM audit_logs;
  DELETE FROM users;
  DELETE FROM products;
  DELETE FROM product_images;
